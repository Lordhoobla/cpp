Though this program covers a lot of stuff, there are still some important stuff to do that this program doesn't cover:
1. Change the "When there are other updates" to "Display Immediately"
2. look through the installed software to find any program that seems suspicious
3. Ask the sender for any extra updates on what may or may not be needed
